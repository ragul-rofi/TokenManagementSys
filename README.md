# Event Management System

A simple console-based event management system that allows clients to create events and allocate tokens for users. This system facilitates event creation, token allocation, and ensures that each user receives a unique token for the event they register for.

## Features

- **Create Events**: Clients can create events by specifying the purpose, location, date, time, and number of tokens.
- **Allocate Tokens**: Users can request tokens for a specific event using an event ID.
- **Unique Token Generation**: Each user receives a unique token number for their event participation.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program**: Execute the Python script in your terminal.
2. **Choose Your Role**:
   - Enter `client` to create an event.
   - Enter `user` to request a token for an existing event.
3. **Follow the Prompts**: Enter the required details as prompted.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. To run the program, simply clone this repository and execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python event_management.py
```
